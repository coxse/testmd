# Development Team : Automation Tool Release Notes, March 2017

Created by Callum Cieciala on 26 Apr, 2017

**Changes**

**Install the Tool –  
**The tool is now a program you install; you do not access it from the server anymore.  
The link to download is: [http://pri-002-aut1/publish/Automations.application](http://pri-002-aut1/publish/Automations.application)  
You can install and create your own shortcut.

  
**Login –  
**You now login by clicking on the application. There is no login form. The authentication is now done from your machine as the user you are logged in as.

Following this, you now do not need any permissions to use the features within the automation tool, an issue with permissions occurred with the use of remote script execution. This has been solved with your account controlling another account with suitable permissions. The only thing required now is to be a part of the automations security group.

**Client Labels -  
**At the top of the automation tool the labels that tell you about the client have now changed, instead of it labelling the PST path, it now gives you the server the PSTs are stored on an there is now a button next to this that specifies the current path the tool is sending the PSTs to.  
  
**Tab Order -**  
The tab order has changed with the addition with more features.  
The order is now: New User, Leaver, Distribution Group, Password Reset, Help, Debug.

**Email Only Clients -  
**When selecting an email only client, there is now a function in the background that cross references a key in the admin tool that stops the search for a remote side. This will now stop connection errors and loading of the remote side entirely, meaning you can only create from “Create Email Only”.  
  
**Help Tab -**  
The help tab has been redesigned so you can copy and paste easier along with fixing the formatting issue occurring in windows 10 which removed all formatting along with spaces. There is now also a checkbox which gives access to the KBs that are available for the automation tool.  
  
**Leaver Tab -**  
Advanced Tab – The query that runs to fetch the disabled users was running on a quick fix, this has now been changed with the implementation of an LDAP query, to allow for quicker retrieval of data.

**New Features**

**Distribution Group Creation –**

The “Distribution Group” tab is for the creation of new distribution groups in our exchange.  
This features Name, Alias, Email Address, Display Name and what OU it belongs to. You can also choose for it to be a distribution or security group (you will have to add extra permissions manually) and you can also choose whether you need to allow external email which is ‘Yes’ by default.

Once all the fields are filled in you can create the group. As previously mentioned you will be added to this group, for testing purposes, so you can test the group and when you come to add members you can remove yourself.  
  
**Password Reset –**  
The “Password Reset” tab has been made as simple and as user friendly as possible.  
Select the local and/or remote user and select whether they need unlocking and/or password resetting. If resetting a password remember to generate a new one.  
  
**Automatic Updates –  
**There is now no need to update, or install a new version, all updates are performed automatically, when an update is available you will be prompted to install, click ok and it will do everything in the background.
